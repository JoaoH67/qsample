MC is very inefficient for low physical error rates since most of the time no actual fault event is realized in simulation. Subset sampling circumvents this issue. With this method, presented in , fault events are categorized into distinct subsets which contribute to a polynomial sum expansion of the logical failure rate. In subset sampling, only the subsets that contribute most to the logical failure rate are actually estimated via sampling – rendering it an importance sampling technique. Both the sampling variance and the uncertainty from ignored, i.e. non-sampled, subsets stay well-defined and can be held small throughout the sampling procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircuit\nProtocol\nError Model\nSimulator\nSampler\n5.1.

Every sampler has 6 callback hooks: * Begin/End sampler * Begin/End protocol * Begin/End circuit\n\n\n\n\nSamples only at one physical error rate pmax\nScaling obtained analytically\npmax must be chosen in “representative” region\n\nNote: 1. For multi-parameter error model pmax is a tuple of one physical error rate per group. 2. The choice of pmax has a direct impact of which subsets are sampled.\nHow to choose pmax? What is the heuristic? * We want to sample, s.t. the subset occurence probability is max. for 0-weight subset and subsequently falling for higher order subsets. * We want to have also relatively high probability for other (important) subsets, i.e. weight-1, weight-2,..\nExample: For the Flagged-GHZ circuit we would choose a pmax close to 0.1:\n\nfrom qsample.sampler.base import subset_occurence, all_subsets, err_probs_tomatrix\n\ngrp = E1().group(ghz).values()\nwgts_combis = all_subsets(grp)\n\nfor p_phy in [0.01, 0.1, 0.3]:\n    Aws = subset_occurence(grp, wgts_combis, p_phy)\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.title(\"Subset occurence prob. $A_w$ at $p_{phy}$=%.2f\" % p_phy)\n    plt.bar(range(len(Aws)), Aws)\n    plt.ylabel(\"$A_w$\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Subsets\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom qsample import SubsetSampler\n\n\npmax = {'q': 0.1}\n\nss_sam = SubsetSampler(ghz3, CHP,  pmax=pmax, err_probs=err_probs, err_model=E1)\nss_sam.run(300)\n\n\n\n\nNote: Although we passed err_probs those are not used for sampling. Only when we call stats() those probs are used:\n\np_L_low, std_low, p_L_up, std_up = ss_sam.stats()\n\nplt.errorbar(sample_range, p_L, fmt='--', c=\"black\", yerr=std, label=\"Direct MC\")\nplt.loglog(sample_range, p_L_low, label='SS low')\nplt.fill_between(sample_range, p_L_low - std_low, p_L_low + std_low, alpha=0.2)\nplt.loglog(sample_range, p_L_up, label='SS low')\nplt.fill_between(sample_range, p_L_up - std_up, p_L_up + std_up, alpha=0.2)\nplt.plot(sample_range, sample_range,'k:', alpha=0.5)\nplt.xlabel('$p_{phy}$(q)')\nplt.ylabel('$p_L$')\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\nWe sampled at a single error rate with much less samples and get a much better bound on the logical error rate. Let’s inspect what has been sampled:\n\nss_sam.tree.draw() # only one tree\n\n\n\n\nWe can store and later reload our sample results:\n\nss_sam.save('ghz3ss.samp')\n\nfrom qsample import Sampler\nstored_sam = Sampler.load('ghz3ss.samp')\ncounts_before = stored_sam.tree.root.counts\n\nstored_sam.run(200) # After loading we can for example run a few more samples.\ncounts_after = stored_sam.tree.root.counts\n\nprint(counts_before, counts_after)\n\n\n\n\n300 500\n\n\nMore complex examples can be found here: https://github.com/dpwinter/qsample/blob/master/08_examples.ipynb\n\n\n\n\n\nsubmit your feature request via github issue\n\n\n\n\nqsample was developed by Don Winter based on and in collaboration with Sascha Heußen under supervision of Prof. Dr. Markus Müller."

In the simplest case this tuple can be understood as a Euclidean coordinate in tick-qubit-space, for example (1,2) for a circuit element at tick 1 on qubit 2, for example a single-qubit gate. However, the second entry in the tuple can also be a tuple of qubits, i.e. (tick_index, (qubitA, qubitB)), for example (1,(2,3)) for a 2-qubit gate in tick 1 from qubit 2 (control) to qubit 3 (target). It is important that (1,(2,3)) \\(\\neq\\) (1,(3,2)) \\(\\neq\\) (1,2)+(1,3). * Common circuit locations can be grouped into a location group (locgrp), for example the set of all 1-qubit gate locations or the set of all idle qubits or all neighboring qubits of 1-qubit gates. A location group is defined by the error model, which sweeps through a circuit and extracts all elements belonging to a certain group. Note that circuit locations can appear in more than one location group and the union of all location groups must not necessarily give all possible circuit locations. This is for example the case for error models which only define errors on gates but not on idle qubits. * By location group weight (locgrp_wgt) we refer to an integer number specifying the amount of location group elements on which to place faults. Note that the weight only specifies the amount, neither the specific element on which the fault is placed (this will be choosen uniformly random) nor the specific error which will be placed (this will be drawn uniformly random from a set of group errors (locgrp_errsets) defined by the error model). * By location group probability (locgrp_prob) on the other hand, we refer to the probability of placing faults on each element of a group. Thus, during circuit execution it will be decided for each element of a location group if an error is placed based on the group probability. * Both the above can be written as vectors over all location groups an error model specifies. The vector of location group weights (locgrp_wgts) thereby characterizes a so-called fault-weight subset, i.e. a particular amount of faults on each location group defined in an error model. These subsets form the sampling space on which we apply importance sampling during subset sampling. * For subset sampling we analytically calculate the subset occurence probability (Aws) as a function of location group probabilities locgrp_probsfor each location group. As a subset occurence probability results from a binomial distribution binom(locgrp_wts, locgrp_lens, locgrp_probs) we also refer to it as binomial weight of a subset, or simply \\(A_w\\), as this is the symbol used in the paper. * If one of the above quantities is preceeded by a protocol_ we have a dictionary with circuit ids (cids) as keys and the given quantity for a circuit as value. Note that locgrp_probs are defined equally for each circuit in the protocol as those represent physical error rates of a (faulty) device which also won’t be different for different circuits in reality. To sample from more than physical error rate a range locgrp_probs_range can be specified which contains a range of error rates for each location group. * locgrp_wgts_combis are all possible locgrp_wgts vectors up to the total number of elements (locgrp_len) in each location group.\n\nsource\n\nprotocol_subset_occurence\n\n protocol_subset_occurence (protocol_groups, protocol_subsets,\n                            group_probs)\n\n\nsource\n\n\nprotocol_all_subsets\n\n protocol_all_subsets (protocol_groups)\n\n\nsource\n\n\nall_subsets\n\n all_subsets (groups)\n\n\nsource\n\n\nsubset_occurence\n\n subset_occurence (groups, subsets, group_prob_range)\n\n\nsource\n\n\nerr_probs_tomatrix\n\n err_probs_tomatrix (err_probs:dict, groups:list)\n\n\nsource\n\n\ntomatrix\n\n tomatrix (mixed_list)\n\n\nsource\n\n\nSampler\n\n Sampler (protocol, simulator, err_probs={'0': {}}, err_model=None)\n\nInitialize self.
